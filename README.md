# Timestamp

> Standard cross-language timestamp object.

## Introduction

This is a simple protobuf encoding for timestamps.

Note: in most cases you will want to use the built-in Protobuf timestamp. This
is just a helpful implementation for those cases where a simpler uint64
millisecond representation makes more sense.
